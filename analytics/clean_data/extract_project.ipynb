You also get a report by the end of each month to see how much money you spent on each category, such as education, transportation, food, etc. I'm currently working on adding a personalized AI roadmap and recepts scanning capabilities into Walley.\r\n\r\nNOTE: My current first priority is to release Walley as an independent mobile app first. After that, desktop UI desgins are next! If you currently sees a mobile UI on my demo page, it's because I'm not yet done with phase 1. Feel free to check out the functionalities that I have finished working on!\r\n\r\nWorking features:\r\n- Budget allocation\r\n- Logging for spending and depositing\r\n- Skeleton framework for lessons (lesson 1 is already out)\r\n- A secure login system powered by Firebase\r\n\r\nWhat I plan to continue working on:\r\n- AI capabilities like in the description\r\n- Lessons 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on\r\n- A new desktop UI with similar elements but more efficient layout\r\n- Publishing the app to App Store in August~!",
