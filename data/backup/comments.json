I‚Äôll make it so normal mode has a block cursor and insert mode the usual ‚Äúline‚Äù cursor. Maybe I‚Äôll add the dreaded replace mode too, with the little slab cursor (it just overwrites characters rather than ‚Äúsmartly‚Äù insert them)About the command mode: this is perhaps a bit weird if you don‚Äôt use vim‚Ä¶ command mode lets you type commands like ‚Äúq‚Äù (to quit the editor,) ‚Äúw‚Äù (to write/save the file,) ‚Äúe [filename]‚Äù (to open text files,) etc. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm implementing here. However, if you type ‚Äú:!‚Äú in Vim, you can run terminal commands like you suggested! I‚Äôll try to implement those too‚Ä¶And yeah.

(you can try this out too) (https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/30ea228abfaa424d12996d74bf6b607909927c30_image.png) ‚Üí here‚Äôs link to t3-app looks like, routes all your files and makes it really easy to do a next.js project After that, I went to Google and found a background image that looks nice. If you want to fact-check that, you can. You can copy the background image and search it up with Google, and you‚Äôll find that.  If you are wondering about the four buttons, two of them come with t3-app, so I added two more underneath, and changed the links to what happens when you click those buttons, it now reroutes to another page. Lemme know if you have anymore questions",
